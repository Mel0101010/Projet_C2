# C2 Client Implementation Presentation

## Project Overview

This presentation covers a Command and Control (C2) client implementation written in C. The project demonstrates network communication, remote command execution, and system interaction capabilities.

## Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture:
- **C2 Server**: Central control node that issues commands
- **Client Agent**: Connects to the server, processes commands, and reports results
- **Communication Protocol**: Text-based, comma-delimited format
- **Task-based Workflow**: Commands are processed as discrete tasks with unique IDs

## Communication Flow

1. **Declaration**: Client registers with server providing system information
2. **Fetch**: Client regularly polls for new commands
3. **Command Processing**: Client executes received commands
4. **Reporting**: Results are sent back to the server

## Key Features

- **System Information Collection**: Username, hostname, OS details
- **File Operations**: Read (CAT), remove (RM), move (MV) files
- **Command Execution**: Run shell commands via EXECVE
- **Reverse Shell**: Create interactive shell connections
- **Sleep Functionality**: Implement timing controls
- **Base64 Encoding**: For secure parameter transmission

## Technical Implementation

- **Modular Design**: Separate components for different functionalities
- **Memory Management**: Careful allocation/deallocation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive checks and error reporting
- **Network Communication**: Socket programming for client-server interaction
- **Process Management**: For command execution and reverse shells

## Security Considerations

- **Parameter Encoding**: Base64 for transmission security
- **Task Identifiers**: Tracking command execution
- **Connection Management**: Proper socket handling

## Development Challenges

- **Memory Safety**: Preventing leaks in string operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from network failures
- **Command Parsing**: Handling complex command formats
- **Process Execution**: Managing subprocesses securely

## Demo Introduction

The following code demonstration will show:
1. How the client connects to the C2 server
2. Command processing implementation
3. Task execution and result handling
4. Base64 encoding/decoding mechanisms
